    "It is convenient to provide an [example Jupyter notebook ](example_notebook/import_mypackage.ipynb) for a new package and add the hooks necessary to run the example with Binder. However, normally the package will not be included in the python path. To do that, one needs a `setup.py` for the package (see [binder docs](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#setup-py)). Once this is done, it is possible to import the package in a notebook running within Binder."
